📌 **Project Overview**

• This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to derive actionable insights into loan performance, borrower behavior, and trends over time. Using Tableau for visualization and SQL for data verification, the analysis covers key loan metrics such as Funded Amount, Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI), Interest Rates, Loan Type, and more.

• The project contains multiple interactive dashboards with intuitive navigation and filters, allowing users to seamlessly explore loan trends across different timeframes and categories.

🎯 **Objectives**

• Analyze loan-related metrics to understand patterns and trends.

• Track Month-over-Month (MoM) and Month-to-Date (MTD) changes in important performance metrics.

• Compare loan trends by state, by month, and by loan category.

• Provide clear, interactive dashboards for easy exploration.

• Validate the dataset using SQL queries before analysis.

🛠 **Tools & Technologies**

• Tableau – Data visualization and dashboard creation.

• SQL – Data validation and verification.
